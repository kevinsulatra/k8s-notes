# Use of Containers

- The history of application development is also the history of packaging these applications for different platforms and operating systems.
- To run an application, specific requirements need to be fulfilled, such as installing and configuring the basic operating system, core Python packages, Python extensions, configuring networking, and connecting to third-party systems like databases and storage.
- While the developer knows the application and its dependencies best, a system administrator usually provides the infrastructure and configures the system.
- This process can be error-prone and hard to maintain, so servers are often configured for a single purpose and connected by network.
- Virtual machines can be used to emulate a full server, allowing multiple isolated servers to run on the same hardware.
- Containers solve the problems of managing application dependencies and running more efficiently than virtual machines, as they do not require running a whole operating system including the kernel.
