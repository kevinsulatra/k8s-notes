# Serverless

- Servers are still required as the basis for applications in a serverless architecture.
- Cloud providers abstract the underlying infrastructure and handle resource provisioning and scaling.
- Serverless computing focuses on on-demand provisioning and scaling of applications.
- Autoscaling based on events allows for precise billing.
- Serverless systems can be used in combination with existing platforms for fast deployment and testing.
- Container images and platforms like Knative are used for packaging and extending serverless systems.
- CloudEvents project provides a specification for structuring event data in a common way.
- CloudEvents simplifies event declaration and delivery across different platforms.
- Applications written for serverless platforms have strict requirements for cloud-native architecture.
