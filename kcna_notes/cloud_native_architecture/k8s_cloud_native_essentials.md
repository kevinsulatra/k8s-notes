# K8s and Cloud Native Essentials

Kubernetes (K8s) and cloud native technologies have become essential in the modern software development landscape. K8s is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

With K8s, organizations can efficiently manage and scale their applications, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. It provides a robust and flexible infrastructure for deploying and managing microservices-based architectures.

Cloud native, on the other hand, refers to a set of practices and technologies that enable organizations to build and operate scalable applications in the cloud. It embraces the principles of scalability, resilience, and agility.

By adopting cloud native practices, organizations can develop applications that are designed to be containerized, dynamically orchestrated, and highly scalable. This approach allows for faster development cycles, easier deployment, and efficient resource utilization.

In summary, understanding and mastering K8s and cloud native essentials is crucial for modern software development teams, as they provide the foundation for building scalable, resilient, and cloud-ready applications.

## **Cloud Native Architecture Fundamentals**

- At the core, the idea of cloud native architecture is to optimize software for cost efficiency, reliability, and faster time-to-market.
- Cloud native architecture combines cultural, technological, and architectural design patterns.
- The Cloud Native Computing Foundation defines cloud native as empowering organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments.
- Cloud native techniques include containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs.
- Cloud native enables loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable.
- Robust automation combined with cloud native techniques allows engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

## **Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture**

- Traditional or legacy applications are usually designed with a monolithic approach, where all functionality is self-contained in a single binary file.
- Monolithic applications can be easy to develop and deploy but difficult to manage complexity, scale development across multiple teams, and implement changes fast.
- Cloud native architecture breaks down applications into smaller, manageable pieces known as microservices.
- Microservices are small, independent applications with clearly defined scopes of functions.
- Multiple teams can own different functions of the application and operate and scale them individually.
- Microservices architecture allows for scalability and efficient resource utilization based on demand.
- Cloud native architecture requires fulfilling certain requirements to work efficiently.
