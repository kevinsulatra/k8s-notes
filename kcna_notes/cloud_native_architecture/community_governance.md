# Community and Governance

 A lot of open source projects that are considered industry standards are supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). CNCF categorizes projects based on maturity, starting from sandbox and incubation stages before graduating. The CNCF community provides support throughout the entire lifecycle of projects, including public visibility and classification in the CNCF Landscape. The CNCF has a Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) responsible for defining and maintaining the technical vision, approving new projects, and accepting feedback. The TOC encourages self-governance and community ownership, following the principle of "minimal viable governance". Guidelines cover project maintenance, review and release processes, user and working groups, and more. Since open source projects rely on their communities, governance differs from traditional approaches. The freedom of cloud native technologies necessitates self-imposed rules and enforcement.
