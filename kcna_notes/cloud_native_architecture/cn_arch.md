# Cloud Native Architecture
Cloud native architecture refers to a set of principles and practices that enable the development and deployment of applications in a cloud environment. It emphasises scalability, resilience, and flexibility.

Popular technologies used in cloud native architecture include:

- **Kubernetes (K8s):** An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications.
- **Docker:** A platform that enables developers to package applications into containers, providing a consistent and portable runtime environment.
- **Microservices:** An architectural approach where applications are broken down into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Service Mesh:** A dedicated infrastructure layer that provides features such as traffic management, service discovery, and security for microservices.
- **Serverless Computing:** A model where cloud providers manage the infrastructure and automatically scale resources based on demand, allowing developers to focus on writing code.
These technologies, among others, enable organizations to build and run scalable and resilient applications in the cloud.
