# Open Standards

- Many cloud native technologies rely on open source software, making it easier to get started and prevent vendor lock-in.
- Collaboration in open source projects allows for the implementation of industry-wide standards.
- Containers have evolved as a standardized way to package and ship modern software.
- Docker is often used as a synonym for containers, but the industry standard is the Open Container Initiative (OCI).
- The OCI provides standards for building and running containers, including image-spec, runtime-spec, and distribution-spec.
- Open standards like these complement systems like Kubernetes, which is the standard platform for orchestrating containers.
- Other open standards include OCI Spec, CNI, CRI, CSI, and SMI.
- Systems like Prometheus and OpenTelemetry provide additional standards for monitoring and observability.
