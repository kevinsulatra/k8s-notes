# **CNCF Graduation Criteria v1.3**

The CNCF Graduation Criteria v1.3 establishes the requirements and guidelines for projects seeking graduation within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). This version of the criteria builds upon the previous versions and provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the maturity and sustainability of projects within the CNCF ecosystem.

The criteria cover several key areas, including project governance, community growth, project releases, and ecosystem support. Projects are evaluated based on factors such as the project's governance model, the diversity and growth of its contributor community, the stability and quality of its releases, and its integration with other CNCF projects and technologies.

By adhering to the CNCF Graduation Criteria v1.3, projects can demonstrate their readiness to become mature and sustainable within the cloud-native landscape. Graduation signifies that a project has met the necessary requirements and has established itself as a reliable and valuable component of the CNCF ecosystem.

The CNCF Graduation Criteria v1.3 is an important resource for both project maintainers and the broader cloud-native community. It sets clear expectations and benchmarks for project success, ensuring the continued growth and success of the CNCF ecosystem as a whole.

## Project Maturity Levels

**Sandbox Stage**

- Entry point for early stage projects
- Intended for projects that warrant experimentation
- Provides a collaborative development environment
- CNCF aims to make the Sandbox the preferred path for early-stage projects
- More mature projects can jump directly to Incubation
- As the cloud-native ecosystem grows, more early-stage projects are expected

**Incubating Stage**

- Project has met the requirements of the Sandbox stage
- Full technical due diligence has been performed
- Being used successfully in production by at least three independent direct adopters
- Has a healthy number of committers
- Demonstrates a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions
- Has a clear versioning scheme
- Clearly documented security processes for reporting and resolving security issues
- Specifications have at least one public reference implementation

### Graduation Stage

To graduate from sandbox or incubating status, or for a new project to join as a graduated project, a project must meet the incubation stage criteria plus:

- Have committers from at least two organizations
- Have achieved and maintained a Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge
- Have completed an independent and third party security audit with results published of similar scope and quality and all critical vulnerabilities need to be addressed before graduation
- Explicitly define a project governance and committer process
- Explicitly define the criteria, process and offboarding or emeritus conditions for project maintainers; or those who may interact with the CNCF on behalf of the project. The list of maintainers should preferably be stored in a [MAINTAINERS.md](http://maintainers.md/) file and audited at a minimum of an annual cadence
- Have a public list of project adopters for at least the primary repo (e.g., [ADOPTERS.md](http://adopters.md/) or logos on the project website). For a specification, have a list of adopters for the implementation(s) of the spec.
- Receive a supermajority vote from the TOC to move to graduation stage. Projects can attempt to move directly from sandbox to graduation, if they can demonstrate sufficient maturity. Projects can remain in an incubating state indefinitely, but they are normally expected to graduate within two years
