# Kubernetes Fundamentals

- **Kubernetes Overview:**
    - Kubernetes, a widely-used open-source container orchestration platform, automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized workloads.
    - This chapter explores the fundamental architecture of a Kubernetes cluster and its components.
    - Originally developed by Google and open-sourced in 2014, Kubernetes v1.0 was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
    - It serves as a centerpiece for various cloud-native technologies, including container runtimes, monitoring, and application delivery tools.
    - Professionals with Kubernetes skills, both in administration and development, are highly sought after in the modern cloud platform landscape.
